	Usage: $ME [options]
	       (shielding $EXEC)

	Instead of invoking $EXEC directly, $ME will prompt the user for the
	machine's hostname to guard against accidental shutdowns/reboots, if the
	current shell is a child of an SSH connection (or --pretend-ssh) has been
	given on the command line, if the shell is connected to an interactive
	terminal, and the actual command to execute is does not involve --help or is
	\`shutdown -c'.

	Only if the user enters the machine's hostname correctly will $ME take
	action. Specifying --molly-guard-do-nothing as argument to the command will
	make $ME echo the command it would execute rather than actually executing
	it.

	The actual command's help output follows:

	_eousage
